title: About
---
- I’m from a little town on the northern coast of Puerto Rico (now emerging from obscurity due to also being the hometown of Bad Bunny). This is still home, where my mom and brother and dog live and I always yearn to return. I never quite feel at home if I’m far from the ocean and the sun, *except* in Bologna.

- My first and enduring intellectual love was and remains understanding “the rest of the world.” Maybe because I grew up in a small town in a small island and couldn’t travel much as a kid,  I always just wanted to see and understand as much of the world as possible. I don’t do well with the idea of staying put in the same place indefinitely, so I recently quit my job to travel for a while and learn things I didn't learn in formal schooling (I studied international relations and economics at Penn and at Johns Hopkins SAIS, and finance via the CFA program).

- Until now (I’m 36), I’ve been a consultant, an emerging markets private equity investor, and a risk management expert in a few settings (a digital assets exchange and a global bank).

- I’m not sure what my career “noun” is or should be yet, which is the other big reason for quitting my job to take an exploratory year off.
  
- I primarily measure life success and satisfaction within a given time period by:

  - number of new countries / places explored

  - number of interesting books read and new things learned (via work or otherwise)

  - (most important) time spent with Sage and my favorite humans

- This sabbatical is an attempt to reorient my life around those things, and figure out what I’m meant to be doing with the little precious time we’re given on this beautiful planet.
