## About me

- I’m from a beautiful little town on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, now emerging from obscurity due to also being the hometown of Bad Bunny. This is still home, where my mom and brother and doggy live and I always yearn to return. I never quite feel at home if I’m far from the ocean and the sun, *except* in Bologna.

- My first and enduring intellectual love was and remains understanding “the rest of the world.” Maybe because I grew up in a small town in a small island and couldn’t travel much as a kid,  I always just wanted to see and understand as much of the world as possible. Accordingly, I studied international relations and economics at Penn and at Johns Hopkins SAIS, and finance via the CFA program. Interests have evolved over time from poli sci/ IR to finance to now more of a science and tech focus - I just like to learn things.
  - Probably because of this, I don’t do well with the idea of staying put in the same place indefinitely, so I recently quit my job to travel for a while (and to learn new things and explore new career paths).
  
- Until now (I’m 36), I’ve been a consultant, an emerging markets private equity investor, and a risk management expert in a few settings (a digital assets exchange and a global bank).
  - I’m not sure what my career “noun” is or should be yet, which is the other big reason for quitting my job to take an exploratory year off.
  
- If I’m honest, I primarily measure life success and satisfaction within a given time period by:
  - hours I spent with my dog(child) Sage (especially at the beach) and my favorite humans
  - number of new countries / places I was able to explore
  - number of interesting books I got to read and how much I got to learn (via work or otherwise)

- This sabbatical is an attempt to reorient my life around those things, and figure out what I’m meant to be doing with the little precious time we’re given on this beautiful planet.
